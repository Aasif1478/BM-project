    <h2>üß† Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        As part of our biomaterials research project, we designed and created a <strong>functional model of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart</strong>. This device is a milestone in biomedical engineering, representing the first permanent total artificial heart implanted in a human. Our model replicates its basic function using <strong>pump mechanisms and wires</strong>, focusing on illustrating the core engineering behind it.

<section>
    <h2>üîß How the Model Was Made</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Miniature pumps</strong> to simulate the two ventricles (right and left).</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible tubing</strong> to mimic arteries and veins.</li>
        <li><strong>Wiring and control switches</strong> for rhythmic pumping.</li>
        <li><strong>3D-printed or hand-molded chambers</strong> for heart compartments.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent casing</strong> to demonstrate internal mechanisms visually.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each part was assembled and demonstrated to show how they contribute to the heart‚Äôs pumping function, including artificial valves and blood flow direction.</p>

    <h2>üìç Where, Why, and When?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Where:</strong> Developed in our school/college biomedical lab.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> To explore how biomaterials and engineering can save lives.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> Completed in <strong>May 2025</strong>, presented at the <em>Annual Science and Innovation Fair</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üåê Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The Jarvik-7 model helped us explore how biomedical devices integrate materials science, biology, and engineering. By replicating this historical device, we gained hands-on insight into the real-world impact of biomaterials in saving lives.
