    <h1>Jarvik-7 Static Artificial Heart Model</h1>
    <p>Exploring Biomedical Engineering Through Hands-On Creativity</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>üß† About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        This project showcases a hand-crafted, <strong>static model of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart</strong>. Inspired by a personal interest in biomedical engineering, the model was created to gain practical understanding of artificial organs‚Äîparticularly the design and structure of artificial hearts.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>üîç What Is the Jarvik-7?</h2>
    <p>
        The Jarvik-7 was the first permanent total artificial heart implanted in a human. It played a significant role in the history of biomedical innovation. My model focuses on representing its physical structure rather than its functionality.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è How the Model Was Made</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The model was built using basic materials such as cardboard, tubing, and wires.</li>
        <li>Each part of the heart was represented using cross-sectional <strong>slices</strong> to illustrate internal structures like ventricles and valves.</li>
        <li>Color-coding and labels were added to make the anatomy clear and educational.</li>
        <li>The model includes separate slices to visually break down chambers and flow paths.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>üéØ Purpose Behind the Model</h2>
    <p>
        This was not created for a competition or exhibition. The model was built purely out of <strong>personal curiosity</strong> and a desire to <strong>gain hands-on experience</strong> in the field of biomedical devices.

    <h2>üìö What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
        Through this project, I gained a clearer understanding of how artificial hearts are structured, how components fit together, and how engineering intersects with human biology. It was a rewarding experience that deepened my interest in biomaterials and prosthetic device design.
